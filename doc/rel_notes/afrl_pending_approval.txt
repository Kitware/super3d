Super3D Release Notes for changes pending release approval by AFRL
==================================================================

This file documents release notes for changes made to Super3D which require
public release approval from AFRL.  After approval, the changes and
corresponding notes below will be incorporated into a public numbered
release version, and the content of this file will be reset.


Updates since last public release
---------------------------------

Depth Library

 * Added support for parsing VisualSFM NVM files.

 * Added a separate helper function for loading MAP-Tk landmark PLY files.
   Generalized PLY loading to handle recent MAP-Tk files that contain
   additional fields.

 * Write out depth maps in the VTK-based file format which is read
   by the MAP-Tk GUI and by the CudeDepthMapIntegration tool

 * Optimized the min_search_bound function to make it 30% faster by
   simplifying the logic, switching to integer calculations where reasonable,
   and additional bounds to allow early search termination.

Tools

 * Added a new "video_depth" tool that computes depth maps for each
   key frame in a video.  Each depth map is built using a neighborhood
   of frames around the key frame.

Fixes since last public release
-------------------------------

Depth Library

 * Fixed a bug in how cost volumes treat missing data (infinite costs), which
   was causing spikes in depth maps in areas of missing data.
