Depth Library

 * Added depth_map_to_height_map and height_map_to_depth_map conversion
   functions given a camera.

 * Added support for parsing VisualSFM NVM files.

 * Added a separate helper function for loading MAP-Tk landmark PLY files.
   Generalized PLY loading to handle recent MAP-Tk files that contain
   additional fields.

 * Write out depth maps in the VTK-based file format which is read
   by the MAP-Tk GUI and by the CudeDepthMapIntegration tool

Tools

 * Added a new "video_depth" tool that computes depth maps for each
   key frame in a video.  Each depth map is built using a neighborhood
   of frames around the key frame.
